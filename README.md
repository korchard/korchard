I am a Software Engineer full of -Knowledge -Innovation -Motivation! I would love to collaborate with others around programming light installations, robot avatars, and other out-of-the-box projects. I would also love to have a conversation around using code in creative ways and would be curious to learn even more posibilities. Let's connect and see what we can create!
